## Morning session: 
# The jelly bean problem:
# How do p-values behave if there is NO difference 
# ("under the null hypothesis"):

# How often do we commit a type I error 
# (= claiming that there is a difference 
# although there is none)?

# What is the specificity
# (= the probability to realize that there is 
# no difference if there is none)?


# How do p-values behave if there is
# a real difference:


# How often do we commit a type II error
# (= claiming that there is NO difference 
# although there is one)?


# What is the sensitivity
# (= the probability to detect the 
# difference, also called "power")?


# Power analysis: How likely is it to miss
# a true effect?



# With Power analysis, I can estimate a sample size
# BEFORE performing the experiment:


## Afternoon session: 
# How to handle files
