## What is Probability?

Resourcen:

- [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)

```{r}
# What if the students of example1.csv choose their seats randomly?
# Create a vector with 7 female and 6 male students

# randomly select 7 students for the first row in the seminar room
 

# What is the probability to observe at least 6 female students in the first row,
# just by chance?
# We need a loop! Example for a loop:


# We want to repeat the random assignment of students to the first row
# in a loop 1000 times.
# We need a vector to store the results:


# How often did we see at least 6 female students in the first row?


# What is the exact p-value for 6 female students in the first row
# from the hypergeometric distribution?



# 3-dimensional arrays: UCBAdmissions as example

## Exercises:
# 1a. Create a barplot showing the proportion (!) of genes involved in
# development among genes with and without CDE (see the pie of Exercise 1a of day 1).


# 1b. Imagine the genes as red (involved in development) and blue 
# (not involved in development) balls in a hat. 
# Simulate drawing 55 genes from the hat. Repeat this 1000 times. 
# How often do you obtain 13 or more red balls 
# (genes that are involved in development)?

# 1c. Obtain the hypergeometric p-value for an enrichment of genes 
# involved in development among genes with a CDE.


# 2a. Show the proportion of male and female students among admitted
# and rejected applicants at UC Berkeley in 1973 as stacked bar plot.


# 2b. Calculate a p-value for an overrepresentation of male students
# among the admitted students.


# 2c. Calculate the admission rates for male and female applicants separately for each department. 
# Try to use subsetting with [].
# Can you identify a department with an obvious bias against women? 


# 2d. Calculate the proportion of male and female applicants per department. 
# Which departments were popular among female applicants?
# Which departments were popular among male applicants?


# 2e. Calculate the overall admission rate (independent of male/female) for each department.


# 2f. Can you explain what happened?

## Homework
# Repeat what you did in Exercise 1a-c for genes in development among genes with and without CDE
# for genes with an AREScore > 5 among cytokine and non-cytokine genes.
